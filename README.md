MTG Portfolio, Market Analysis, Inventory

Rough Draft 20230726

1. Manually collect all inventory - Scanning cards using Delver Lens app and pasting them into dirty CSVs. Creating master arrays for "Physical Inventory", "Scryfall Scraping", and "Cost/Benefit Analysis"
2. Scrape Scryfall for cross-examination - data cleanup using Scryfall as template, scrape using their API
3. Visuals Testing  - Create skeleton visuals and analysis using libraries only, will move to create more front-end friendly UI
4. Investment Analysis - Create algorithms and procedures for monitoring whole protfolio and top-moving cards in market
5. Physical Allocation - Organize library using system for archiving and deck-building wihtout sacrificing inventory integrity
6. Web Interface - Host UI connected to database for easier access
7. App - Create a mobile app designed for consumer use as a "Robinhood for MTG Nerds", social aspect for MTG collections, looking at collections, looking at value, trading opportunities (e.g Facebook Marketplace)

 Phase 1 is still ongoing. Done 20K/~37K cards so far. Expected due date Oct 2023.
 Phase 2 will take place using select CSVs for scraping Scryfall. Start date Aug 2023. 

Test Cases: Delver Lens

Draft: 20230906

Phase Updates:
1. ~90% complete. Uncommons and rares scanning complete. Remainder commons and cards left from first pass of scanning. Discussion of any and all cards with a number (i.e. tokens, official proxies) will be counted. At 100%, will discuss phasing out dependence on Delver Lens.
2. Prototype built on skeleton example mentioned in previous draft. Will post once I deem it worthy to be functional and secure of theft/unauthorized manipulation.
3. Exploration limited as Phase 1 has taken 10 months to manually do. Will start with Altair for functional visuals. Possibly explore Tableau as a partnered option. If not, may find other frameworks or commission own set of visuals
4. Created a skeleton template to send for property insurance purposes. This will be the first contact with the financial aspect to explore and configure to protocols and culture alike.
5. Parts of it have been completed in collection with Phase 1, the final step will be a particular coding structure (cf. Dewey Decimal System) used for physical organization. It will be internal only to start and work our way to create a public structure fit for consumer use.
6. Pending
7. Pending. Spoken to some groups with initial interest in investment and contribution.
